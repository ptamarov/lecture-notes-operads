\begin{abstract}
This lecture series aim to offer a gentle introduction to the theory of algebraic 
operads, starting with the elements of the theory, and progressing slowly towards
more advanced themes, including (inhomogeneous) Koszul duality theory, Gr\"obner 
bases and higher structures. The course will consist of approximately twelve 
lectures, along with extra talks by willing participants, with the goal of 
introducing extra material to the course, and making them more familiar with the 
theory.
